<h1>Charity Match</h1>

//100 word app description

<p>The need for volunteers is increasing every year, especially for kids under 16.
Volunteering makes kids more productive and informed about the world, 
so our app utilizes fun personality tests that appeal to the younger generation
to suggest charities and organizations to volunteer for. The app includes 
multiple quizzes that connect the user with charity. Then, they can contact the
charity directly from the app with a pre-set email to make it quick and easy. 
Now, preteens can get involved with volunteering in a fun and simple way.</p>
